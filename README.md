# Virtual Pet

I have created a virtual pet that demands consistent attention, or you will pay.

# How to start the app:

You can also change the times for each event to happen in the data section in src/components/petVue.vue

# Life of the pet

<h3> Feed </h3>
<br>
If you don't feed your pet he turns skinny

If you still don't feed it, your lovely pet dies

<h3> Poke </h3>
<br>
<p>If you don't keep your pet awake by poking it he falls asleep</p>

If he sleeps to long, he turns off the lights and puts your computer to sleep

<h3> Pet </h3>
<br>
When the pet is relaxed he doesn't use up to much resources

But don't pet him often enough and he starts trying to get attention

And if you keep ignoring him he will let you know
